# Efficient Learning in Computer Aided Diagnosis
The paper was published in SPIE Medical Imaging. It focused on building classifiers for data with no true labels, only multiple "noisy" labels per instance. The code for experiments is in my `MedIX` repository. I have it as private since it is a shared repository, but if you reach out I would be happy to share it!
