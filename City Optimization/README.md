# City Optimization

This project was a part of CompSci 524: Introduction to Optimization. My final project posed city planning as an optimization problem and solved it through the language Julia in a jupyter notebook. There is extensive use of LaTeX in the notebook which causes LaTeX to not appear in the GitHub notebook viewer; I recommend downloading the notebook to view it.
