## Projects

#### 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

- Developed traditional and all-convolutional 3D CNNs for a simulated 3D MNIST dataset in the Pytorch Python package and leveraged Google GPUs through Google Colaboratory
- Implemented an additional architecture from a deep learning medical imaging academic journal (3D convolutional neural networks for classification of functional connectomes, Khlosa et al., 2018)
- Project further discussed on my instructor's (Prof. Sebastian Raschka) personal blog (sebastianraschka.com)

#### Kernel Principal Component Analysis (kPCA)

- Mathematically formulated kPCA from the foundations of standard principal component analysis (PCA)
- Examined the power of kPCA with various kernels and simulated high dimensional data in R via the package kernlab

#### City Optimization

- Modeled a city planning task as a mixed integer program in Julia to optimize aggregate city "performance" subject to realistic constraints like zoning laws and long-term "intelligent" planning
- Applied the up-and-coming language Julia, the JuMP modeling language, and optimization solvers such as Gurobi, Mosek, Knitro, and Ipopt
