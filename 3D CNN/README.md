# 3D CNNs

This was the final project for Stat 479: Deep Learning. This project applied 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to a 3D classification dataset. We made implemented types of networks, a standard CNN (convolutional and fully connected layers), an all-convolutional network, and a network from a modern deep learning research paper (specified in the report).
