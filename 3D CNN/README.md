# 3D CNNs

This was my final project for Stat 479: Deep Learning. It is featured on my awesome professor's [website](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2019/student-gallery-1.html).

We applied 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to a 3D classification dataset. We made implemented types of networks, a standard CNN (convolutional and fully connected layers), an all-convolutional network, and a network from a modern deep learning research paper (specified in the report).
