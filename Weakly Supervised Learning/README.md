# Expanding annotated data with informed labels for weak supervision
This paper was published in the International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining. It generalized our weakly supervised classifier (my SPIE paper) to other datasets and analyzed its effectiveness. The code for the experiments is in the `MedIX` repository. I have it as private since it is a shared repository, but if you reach out I would be happy to share it!
